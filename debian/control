Description: Distributed Jabber server
 djabberd is a high-performance, scalable, extensible Jabber/XMPP
 server framework. While it comes with an example server, it's
 really a set of classes for you to build your own Jabber server
 without understanding Jabber. Instead of working with XML and
 protocol-specific details, you subclass parts and work with sane
 objects and data structures and let DJabberd do all the ugly work.
