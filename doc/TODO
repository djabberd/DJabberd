-- on connect, set clientin 'cached_roster' field to '1' or something,
   then first caller (get roster IQ or initial presence) that
   loads roster sets it in cached_roster, registers a timer for 10 seconds to
   then wipe it.  the idea being that the other caller gets it for free in those
   10 seconds, then it's wiped and we go back to using less memory.

-- make "sub send_presence_probes" in Connection/ClientIn a hook so the whole thing can be
   bypassed:  then LiveJournal can do this all in web land, looking up all contacts, looking
   at all presence status/locations in databases, and injecting the presence replies back
   into djabberd at once from webland.  then we bypass all the rosteritem loading and cluster-wide
   probe delivery

-- hook on successfully bound JID / unbound JID to register in database where somebody is

-- field in Presence.pm packet that is 'trusted' that can bypass some of the double-roster-itme
   loading in Presence.pm, especially 'sub process_incoming'

-- RosterLoadItem hook optional:  by default maybe just do LoadRoster and get it from there?
   inefficient, though.

-- before authenticated (and ever after authenticated) only capture data when people XML nodes
   for a fixed amount of bytes/time before disconnecting client as possibly malicious

   (10:51:49) matt@sergeant.org: you're using a socket per DNS query
   (10:55:08) matt@sergeant.org: it means your responses end up overlapping if you do more than 65k concurrent queries, and sometimes before then.
   (10:55:48) matt@sergeant.org: there's a long protracted discussion of this in the SpamAssassin archives.
   (10:55:58) matt@sergeant.org: no it often happens way before that many queries
   (10:58:12) matt@sergeant.org: anyhow, feel free to steal qpsmtpd's Danga::DNS

-- presence priority

-- allow a fast path when bulk sending tons of messages (like hundreds of unavailable stanzas
   on disconnect):  allow a means to, given a set of full/bare (at least bare) JIDs, filter out
   the ones to be known not available.  (for instance, local/cluster
   ones, where we're the authority on their presence).

-- optimization:  when sending out presence to ourselves, we double-check the rosteritem
   status for filtering reasons on its way back "in", when it loops back to ourselves in
   procdeliver.  we should set an "its_us_so_trust_us" flag and then
   we fast-path that, avoiding the lookup.

-- can we reuse s2s connections in both directions?  Our code doesn't, but worse,
   I don't think it'd even allow other people to try and do it to us.  What does spec say?

-- s2s and client timeouts

-- cleanup/unifiy callbacks.... error vs. fail, on_data vs set vs loaded, etc...
  give them types?

-- debian install guide.

-- debian packaging

-- make SSL configuration easier:  configurable locations of keys,
   and bitch if configured and not configured

-- $stanza->process and $stanza->deliver take a $conn, but
   now that stanzas always know their connection, that
   parameter is kinda useless.  remove them all?
     -- actually, we should also store a non-weak vhost ref
        in stanzas, then use that for delivery/etc, since
        conn as a weakref can go away if client disconnects
        and we may still want to process/deliver.

-- Jingle/Asterisk stuff:

   This Jabber client supports Jingle:
     http://www.kismith.co.uk/wordpress/index.php/2005/12/16/i-say-i-say-i-say-did-you-hear-the-one-about/
     http://psi-im.org/wiki/Jingle_branch
   So think we could do the Jingle stuff Jabber-server-side and get the Psi
   client connecting to Asterisk over SIP or something?

-- speed up XMLElement as_xml ... try to reuse the original scalarref read from the network, if
   we can align the boundaries of XML stanzas to network reads.  XML::Parser::Expat can help
   us:  (where $self->{parser} is our incremental parser), but we're using LibXML now.

    print Dumper("eobj = " . eval { $self->{parser}->_expat_obj->current_byte });
    $VAR1 = 'eobj = 22';

-- <not-authorized/> -- the sender must provide proper credentials
