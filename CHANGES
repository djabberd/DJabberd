0.84_01 (2009-07-31) dev release because it's beeen awhile

  - SARTAK caught a typo in BotContext.pm where a qr was used in a place
    that obviously should have been qq.

  - "use bytes" in Connection.pm, which reportedl fixes UTF-8
    corruption in rosters (Aleksey Luzin <subscr@p34.net>)

  - If an explicit configuration file location is given to djabberd,
    don't fall back on the built-in default locations. If the user
    wanted the defaults, he wouldn't have used the --conffile option.

    set via a command-line argument to djabberd.
    (Jakob Burkhart <igotimac@gmail.com>)
